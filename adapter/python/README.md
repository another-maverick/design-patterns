# Adapter pattern

* For example, new code that implement an interface. we have legacy code that needs to implement the same interface. We can use an adapter here

* It can be recognized when we receive another object in the interface of the adapter. when a method is called on the object, the adapter makes necessary changes to the variables, data structures etc.
